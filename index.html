                    Palestine, the land of prophets, martyrs, resistance and steadfastness, and the ongoing conflict between truth and falsehood, sits at the heart of the Middle East and with it the Israeli occupation conflict extends for more than seventy years.

                    Palestine is one of the important historical and geographical territories in the Middle East. Palestine is located in the southeastern part of the Mediterranean Sea, bordered by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, and its capital is Jerusalem. Palestine represents the meeting point of the two continents, Asia and Africa. The area of Palestine is about 27 thousand square kilometers.

                    Britain took control of Palestine after defeating the Ottoman Empire, which ruled this part of the Middle East, in World War I.This land was inhabited by the Palestinians, and then Britain established a Zionist homeland for the Jews in the land of Palestine in 1948, so they killed and displaced everyone, stole the land and built settlements on it, and they remain so today.

                    In 2006, Israel imposed a land, air and sea blockade on the Gaza Strip, increasing the siege of Gaza to the number of 1.8 million Palestinians, who have been under Jewish occupation since 1967. What is striking, and no less important than the subject of the blockade, is the way the Palestinians adapt to the miserable situation in which they live there. The Palestinians in Gaza found themselves forced to come up with solutions that would help them adapt to the tragic living situation resulting from the siege, which led to a severe shortage of the basic materials they needed, such as food and fuel, and also hindered the process of economic growth in the Strip for a long period, in addition to other problems. There are many others, such as the difficulty of obtaining medical services, clean drinking water, or even the necessary education for their children.

                  <p>
                    During the period of the siege, Israel launched a military aggression against the Gaza Strip several times in the years 2008, 2012, 2014, 2021, and 2023. These military attacks exacerbated the tragic situation in the Gaza Strip, as tens of thousands of homes, schools, and public and commercial buildings were destroyed. The process of rebuilding it seems almost impossible; Because the Israeli siege imposed on Gaza prevents the entry of building materials necessary for reconstruction.

                  <p>
                    The people of the Gaza Strip are doing their best to live a normal life in light of the intense suffering and artistic experiences. They derive their determination from their need to adapt to these conditions, which is an indication of their strength and determination to resist the occupation.

                    The history of the city of Jenin dates back to ancient times, and it is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world. It is located in the occupied West Bank of Palestine. Jenin Governorate consists of the city of Jenin (the center), Jenin Camp, and a group of villages. The city was known for its resistance to the Israeli occupation, especially its camp, which became a symbol of steadfastness and resistance. It is subjected to continuous military operations in an attempt to eliminate the resistance there. Jenin camp is considered a stronghold for the Palestinian resistance factions that united to confront the Israeli forces. It is also a center for those wanted by the occupation resistance, so it is constantly exposed to Israeli military operations and raids with the aim of eliminating the resistance and arresting wanted persons.

                  <p>
                    The Israeli occupation also attacks the city of Jenin on a daily basis, killing and bombing hysterically.

                <p>The Palestinian people continue to suffer as a result of the occupation, which prevents them from obtaining their basic human rights, threatens human security, and stands as an obstacle to achieving any tangible progress in terms of human development. The economic situation has also been exacerbated by the ongoing separation between the West Bank and Gaza, stagnant economic growth, the ongoing financial crisis, and high unemployment rates, as well as widespread poverty and food insecurity.</p>
